--Strings in Java

Strings in Java are Objects that are backed internally by a char array. Since arrays are immutable, Strings are immutable as well. 
Whenever a change to a String is made, an entirely new String is created.


What is String Pool in Java?

JVM divides the allocated memory to a Java program into two parts. one is Stack and another one is heap. Stack is used for execution purpose and heap is used for storage purpose. 
In that heap memory, JVM allocates some memory specially meant for string literals. This part of the heap memory is called String Constant Pool. (String Pool is a storage area in Java heap).
Whenever you create a string object using string literal, that object is stored in the string  pool and whenever you create a string object using "new" keyword, such object is stored in the heap memory.

---The JVM performs some steps while initializing string literals to increase performance and decrease memory overhead.
    To decrease the number of String objects created in the JVM, the String class keeps a pool of strings.

---Each time a string literal is created, the JVM checks the string literal pool first. If the string already exists in the string pool, 
a reference to the pooled instance returns. If the string does not exist in the pool, a new String object initializes and is placed in the pool.
